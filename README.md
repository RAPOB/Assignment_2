Welcome to the Advanced-Calculator MKI
--------------------------------------
The Advanced Calculator MKI is a simple calculator which performs addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division. It displays inputs on the first (right to left) 3 HEX displays and the outputs on the 
first 6 HEX displays (right to left). Negative signs in both cases are displayed on HEX7 (far left
HEX display). It can also perform memory operations such as store current value, recall stored value,
clear stored value, reset (which resets the calculator and clears the registers), and backspace (which
removes the most recent input number).
